# GPU-Image-Effects-Demonstration

This project applies multiple image processing effects using GPU-accelerated operations in Python.
It processes a single image and generates different visual effects such as blur, edge detection, sharpening, quantization, embossing, grayscale, and color inversion.

Project Description
The goal of this assignment is to show how GPU can speed up image processing.
I used one high-resolution image (rose.jpg) and applied several filters using OpenCV and NumPy.
The code also records the processing time for each effect.

Effects Applied
The program generates:
Strong Gaussian Blur
Canny Edge Detection
Bilateral Filter
Sharpening
Color Quantization (Posterize effect)
Emboss Effect
Grayscale Conversion
Color Inversion
A combined image showing all results

Output contains:
Input image - rose.png
Processed images - processed_results.png
